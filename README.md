<h1>Statusfi</h1>
<p>This project started as an idea. <small>(no way bro, thats crazy <i>/sarc</i>)</small></p>
<p>The idea was to make a website that helps people understand what people's status really meant. After seeing people on Discord put it in their 'About Me' section, I thought, "Is there a way to make that better?" <b>That's why I'm making this.</b></p>
